### InfiniBand Protocol
InfiniBand is a high-speed communication protocol designed for data centers and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. It operates at both the physical and link layers, utilizing multiple lanes for data transfer, with each lane comprising differential pairs for high throughput and low latency communication. InfiniBand supports remote direct memory access (RDMA), allowing for efficient data transfers directly between the memory of different computers without involving the CPU, which significantly reduces latency and CPU overhead [oai_citation:1,Chapter 1. Understanding InfiniBand and RDMA | Red Hat Product Documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_infiniband_and_rdma_networks/understanding-infiniband-and-rdma_configuring-infiniband-and-rdma-networks) [oai_citation:2,Overview of the InfiniBand Protocol](https://resources.system-analysis.cadence.com/blog/overview-of-the-infiniband-protocol).

### RoCE Protocol
RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) extends RDMA capabilities over Ethernet networks. There are two main versions of RoCE:
- **RoCE v1:** An Ethernet link layer protocol that enables communication within the same Ethernet broadcast domain.
- **RoCE v2:** Operates at the network layer over UDP, allowing for routing between different Ethernet networks.

RoCE requires specific hardware, and configuration typically involves setting the appropriate RoCE version on both client and server to ensure compatibility. Mellanox, Broadcom, and QLogic are among the common hardware vendors for RoCE solutions [oai_citation:3,Chapter 1. Understanding InfiniBand and RDMA | Red Hat Product Documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/configuring_infiniband_and_rdma_networks/understanding-infiniband-and-rdma_configuring-infiniband-and-rdma-networks) [oai_citation:4,Configuring InfiniBand and RDMA networks | Red Hat Product Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/configuring_infiniband_and_rdma_networks/index).
